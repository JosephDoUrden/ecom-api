# üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üìå Project Overview

The **E-Commerce API** is a modular and scalable backend system designed to support e-commerce platforms. It provides features such as user authentication, role-based access control, product and order management, and integration with third-party tools like Swagger and Docker.

---

## üéØ Goals

1. **Core Functionality**: Provide a robust backend for managing users, products, categories, carts, orders, and payments.
2. **Security**: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
3. **Scalability**: Ensure the API is modular and can integrate with additional features like Redis, Kafka, and AWS S3.
4. **Developer Experience**: Offer clear documentation, Swagger integration, and a well-structured codebase.

## üõ† Features

### 1. **User Management**
- **Roles**: `ADMIN`, `VENDOR`, `CUSTOMER`.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login and registration.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for endpoints.

### 2. **Product & Category Management**
- CRUD operations for products and categories.
- Support for product variations (e.g., size, color).
- Stock tracking.

### 3. **Cart & Order Management**
- Add, update, and remove items from the cart.
- Create orders from the cart.
- Track order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

### 4. **Payment Simulation**

- Secure Swagger UI with Bearer Token authentication.

### 7. **Optional Features**
- Redis caching for faster product/category retrieval.
- Kafka for event-driven architecture.
- AWS S3 for image uploads.
